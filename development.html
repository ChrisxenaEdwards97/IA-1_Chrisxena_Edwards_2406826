      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Reading <em>Twelve Pillars</em> changed the way I think about success, purpose, and learning throughout life. Chapter 4-7 shares important lessons about setting goals, managing time, finding mentors, and growing as a person. These ideas made me think about my own experiences as a student and as someone who wants to work in computing, and they helped me see how I can build better habits for long-term success.

      <h2>Chapter 4 – Achieve Your Goals</h2>
      <p>
       This chapter highlights the importance of having well-defined, written goals for achieving success. Jim Rohn articulated that goals serve as a roadmap, directing us towards the life we aspire to lead. In their absence, we navigate without purpose or clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal experience, this has highlighted that both academic and personal achievements necessitate a structured approach. I have begun to establish short-term objectives, such as finishing assignments ahead of schedule, as well as long-term aspirations, including graduating with honors and pursuing a career in technology. By clearly defining these goals, I gain a sense of direction and motivation

      <h2>Chapter 5 – The Proper Use of Time</h2>
      <p>
        Chapter 5 emphasizes that time is among our most precious resources. Each moment we utilize influences our future, and once it is gone, time cannot be recovered. Rohn’s message inspires readers to utilize their time judiciously and concentrate on significant endeavors.
      </p>
      <p>
        This message prompted me to contemplate my daily routine. I came to the realization that I was dedicating excessive time to multitasking rather than focusing on one task at a time. I now utilize planners and to-do lists to organize my study periods, allowing space for relaxation and creativity. Understanding the importance of time has enhanced my discipline and concentration

      <h2>Chapter 6 – Surround Yourself with the Best</h2>
      <p>
        In this chapter, Rohn emphasizes that the individuals in our vicinity can either motivate or constrain us. The companions we choose influence the benchmarks we establish for ourselves and the drive we experience.
      </p>
      <p>
     I formed a profound connection with this lesson as my surroundings at UTech consistently motivate me to develop. The presence of diligent peers, nurturing mentors, and uplifting influences compels me to maintain my consistency. I have come to understand that success is not attained in isolation, but rather through a community of supportive individuals who have shared aspirations.
      </p>

    <section class="dev-section">
      <h2>Chapter 7 – Be a Lifelong Learner</h2>
      <p>
       Chapter 7 highlights the significance of ongoing education. Rohn articulates that genuine success necessitates perpetual development, acquiring new abilities, adjusting to transformations, and maintaining curiosity even after reaching significant achievements.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a computing student, I find this particularly relatable. The rapid evolution of technology necessitates a willingness to embrace new programming languages, tools, and methodologies. I have come to understand that each project or challenge presents a chance for personal growth, and I intend to pursue learning well beyond my time at university.
