      <h2>🎵 Favourite Music</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>“Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill You)” – Kelly Clarkson</strong><br>
          I love this song because it reminds me that challenges make me tougher and more resilient, no matter what comes my way.
        </li>
        <li><strong>"Eternity"- Alex Warren </strong><br>
          It’s my reflection song — it reminds of my Grandfather who is in a better place now. The regrets I have for not being able to support him before he past. A reminder that my parents are still here and some day they will be depending on me. A reminder of what i am working for.
        </li>
        <li><strong>“Unstoppable” – Sia</strong><br>
          This song’s energy and message about confidence and strength keep me focused and empowered during stressful times.
        </li>
